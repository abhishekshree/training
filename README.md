Task 2 -> I tried to start with the PD Controller part, although I went through a lot of lectures I could not understand. I tried to go through some content on wikipedia about PID systems and how they work, wrote some python code for a linear system through a tutorial. But could not proceed with the assignment.
I completed the ROS Tutorial partially, but was not able to complete the tutorial and the first problem. I was not able to make time to cover ROS in the past 2 weeks as I was working on the website and then SnT summer project started and the last week was totally wasted due to vaccine :/
